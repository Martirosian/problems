## What to do

We've included a [copy](template.html) of [now-ui-kit](http://demos.creative-tim.com/now-ui-kit/index.html) [template](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/now-ui-kit/blob/master/documentation/template.html) with some cleanup and scrubbing applied that we want you to use as a foundation to implement a few wireframes with. We've split this problem into two tasks - [navigation](#task-navigation) and [results](#task-results) and they describe a quick-search interface that is triggered from the navigation and a set of search results pages grouped in tabs.

#### Task: Navigation

In this task we want you to implement a search UI that is accessed from a navigation bar.

- [template](template.html)
- [wireframes](wireframes/navigation.html)

#### Task: Results
